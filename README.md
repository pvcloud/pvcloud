# pvcloud - The Pura Vida Cloud
=======

pvCloud is a cloud system for the Internet of the Things that aims to enable makers to quickly prototype and share their inventions in a social network fashion in a simple manner.

The current status of the project is 'in development' and no BETA or PROD release has been done yet. But you can look into the code, fork it, make use of it on your own risk according to the licence.

I expect to have a more formal "1.0" release soon, perhaps by January 2016 for academic purposes.

## Main Components

pvCloud's Architecture includes the following main components:
   1. pvCloud Web UI
   2. pvCloud ESV API Driver
   3. pvCloud ARDUINO Library

Additionally we are working on some demos that use pvCloud on specific inventions.

## Development Environment and Design
